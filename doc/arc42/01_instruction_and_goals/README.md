# Introduction and Goals

BER is short for Badminton ELO Ranking. It should rank most Badminton players from Germany in ranking. For each win-loss you get or loose according to the rules of the ELO ranking. The results should be shown in a comprehensive web app.

This is a just-for-fun project by Christian. It will go live in 2018, however it is very likely that this posponed :)

## Requirements Overview

Due to the simplicity of the project, the requirements are simply listed:

I as a player...
* ... want to see the total ranking

* ... want to see my current rating

* ... want to see my rating trend

* ... want to see my matches and how they altered my rating

* ... do not want to enter the data manually, but being used from current platforms (turnier.de/nuliga)

* ... want to see my matches being accounted for at most 1 day after they've been played


I as a developer/hoster ...

* ... want the app to be hosted completely on any PaaS (like Amazon AWS)

* ... want the app to be developed in Spring (since i want to learn it :))

* ... want the frontend to be developed in Typescript with Angular


## Quality Goals

Since this is a fun project, the main goal is to have less work with it :)
